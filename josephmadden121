score_df <- read.csv("/Users/josephmadden/R_Projects/DSC520/data/scores.csv") 
score_df
# 1. What are the observational units in this study?
dim(score_df)
# it shows 38 observations and 3 variables.

# 2. Identify the variables mentioned in the narrative paragraph and determine which are categorical and quantitative? str(score_df)
# 2. Variables mentioned in the narrative paragraph are section, course grades and total points earned in the course. 
#    section is categorical
#    Assuming course grades to be character like 'A', 'B', so it is categorical.
#    Total Points is quantitative
#    Looking at the score.csv file, I found count, score and section variable. 
#    Where Count and score is quantitative and section variable is categorical.

# 3. Create one variable to hold a subset of your data set that contains only the Regular Section and one variable for the Sports Section.

reg_df <- subset(score_df, score_df$Section == "Regular") 
reg_df

sport_df <- subset(score_df, score_df$Section == "Sports") 
sport_df

# 4. Use the Plot function to plot each Sections scores and the number of students achieving that score. 
#    Use additional Plot Arguments to label the graph and give each axis an appropriate label.

install.packages("ggplot2") 
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(reg_df, aes(x=Score, y=Count)) + geom_point() 
ggplot(sport_df, aes(x=Score, y=Count)) + geom_point()

ggplot(reg_df, aes(x=Score, y=Count)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Regular Section Distribution") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + xlab("Score - Total Points ") + ylab("Count(Number of Students")
  
ggplot(sport_df, aes(x=Score, y=Count)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Sport Section Distribution") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + xlab("Score - Total Points ") + ylab("Count(Number of Students)")
  
# Once you have produced your Plots answer the following questions:
# 4.a. Comparing and contrasting the point distributions between the two section,
       looking at both tendency and consistency: Can you say that one section tended to score more points
       than the other? Justify and explain your answer.
# 4.a  Both regular and sports sections are doing good to score more points
       but sport section scored more grade points of 395 where as regular section scored 380 as highest grade point. 
       Also we can see there are 10 students who scored 395 in sports section.
       where as 20 students in regular section scored 380 grade points.
       
# 4.b. Did every student in one section score more points than every student in the other section? 
       If not, explain what a statistical tendency means in this context.
       
ggplot(score_df, aes(x=Score, y=Count, col=Section)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Section Distribution") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + xlab("Score - Total Points ") + ylab("Count(Number of Students") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_sdl", geom = "linerange", colour = "red", size = 2, mult = 1)
  
#      We can clearly see in above graph that not every student of one section have scored more point than the students of other section. 
#      at some places sport section student scored highest and in some places regular section student scored highest grade points.

  stat_central_tendency(aes(color = Section), type = "mean", linetype = 2)
  
#     The plotted graph is showing the mean of regular section in red dashed line and mean of sports section in green dashed line.

# 4.c. What could be one additional variable that was not mentioned in the narrative 
#      that could be influencing the point distributions between the two sections? 
# Ans  The only variable that was not discussed in narrative is count
#      which is the number of students scoring same grade or total points.
#      This variable is important as it is showing how many students scored highest grade point and 
#      which section student grade is consistent or which section student scored highest grades.

# perform a modification to the data, and then bring it back together

ggplot(housing_df, aes(x=sale_instrument, y=`Sale Price`)) + geom_point() 
ggplot(housing_df, aes(x=sale_reason, y=`Sale Price`)) + geom_point()

e. Identify if there are any outliers
e. plotting sale_instrument vs sale price, we can see for sale_instrument 22,
there are two values which lies at some distant compare to other observation data point.
Also for sale_instrument 4 we have increase in sale price but this does not seems to be an outlier as we see gradual increase in sale price.

plotted sale_reason vs sale price.
i see gradual increase for sale reason 1 and others, i do not see outlies for this plot.

Create at least 2 new variables

ddply(housing_df, .(sale_reason), mutate, sumby_SaleReason = sum(`Sale Price`), 
      meanby_SaleReason = mean(`Sale Price`))
